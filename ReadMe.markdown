# homebrew-experimental #

A `homebrew` tap containing some experimental formulae for development and testing

Primarily a tap for [apache-config](https://github.com/MPLew-is/apache-config) and [brew-blend](https://github.com/MPLew-is/homebrew-blend), to allow installation through homebrew

Also contains a limited number of initial `brew-blend` formulae in the `BlendFormulae` directory
